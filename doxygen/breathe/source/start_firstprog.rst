First Program
=============

Your first Program: Hello World !
---------------------------------

Now that we have correctly build and installed the n3rv library, we will start to code.
The goal here is to create a simple program that will instanciate 2 nodes and a service controller. 
Node 1 will repeateadly send the string "Hello World" to Node 2, 
which will display it as a log entry on its standard output.
