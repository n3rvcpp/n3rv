Classes List
-------------

You will find here the exaustive list of the usable 
classes in the n3rv library. 

Service Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main class of the project, every user defined service inherit from this class.
:doc:`See Class Documentation <service>`

Logger Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Provides timestamped logging to your service, which output can be files and/or stdout.
:doc:`See Class Documentation <logger>`

Service Controller Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class allows to instanciate a service controller, which plays 
the role of endpoints directory.
:doc:`See Class Documentation <servicecontroller>`

Topology Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This class allows to load and parse topologies, which allows to automatically 
bind/connect to service endpoints.
:doc:`See Class Documentation <topology>`

Hello World

    #include <n3rv/n3rvservice.hpp>
    #include <n3rv/n3rvservicecontroller.hpp>

        //This service continuously broadcasts "
        //Hello World" to a publish endpoint.
        class hellosend: public n3rv::service {
        using n3rv::service::service;
        public:

        //here you can declare connections to other services 
        // to bind and/or establish, and other service initialization directices.

        //service to receive its broadcasts.

        };

        int main() {

        n3rv::start_controller("0.0.0.0",10001,true,4);

        hs.initialize();
        hs.run_async();
