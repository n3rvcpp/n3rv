What is n3rv ?
--------------

n3rv is a C++ library that leverages the power of ZeroMQ to create multiservices architectures.
Using ZMQ as core communication mechanism, n3rv basically provides all the components that 
modern services development requires, meaning:

 - A Services Directory & subscribing mechanism.
 - An events handler.
 - Messages encapsulation methods.
 - Logging.
 - An HTTP/ZeroMQ gateway.
 - Dynamic architecture reconfiguration.

Actually it is quite similar to `Facebook's fbzmq <https://github.com/facebook/fbzmq/>`_, 
but easier to use and with more features.

How does it work ?
------------------

Running nodes create ZMQ socket bindings, then register them to a directory service 
(service controller). Each update of the directory triggers a broadcast-update on all the 
nodes, thus making the bindings joinable by everyone.

From the developer's perspective, n3rv lets you implement custom service classes, inheriting from 
the `n3rv::service` superclass. In these custom classes you will describe the complete behaviour 
of your services:

 - Which sockets they must bind.
 - Which nodes they must connect to.
 - Backend interractions.
 - Business rules, ..

After that, you just need to instanciate your defined service classes to let the magics begin !
